# quantum_learning

In constant.py there are some useful constants.

In particle_in_a_box.py there is the implementation of a class about the quantum problem of a particle in a monodimensional box.
Both the wavefunction and the energy are implemented and there is the possibility to inspect the graph of the wavefunction for 
a given quantum number.
